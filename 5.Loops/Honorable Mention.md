Normally, I would  not write this, due to assuming readers already know basic Java or coding in other languages.

Yet, I feel like having to mention one thing. Iterating over arrays/values in reverse.

You know how for loops work right?

```java
for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
	System.out.println(i)
}
```
This will start indexing from 0 and will stop at fifth element.

Now, this will be useful for printing arrays in reverse, or values in reverse.

```java
for(int i=5;i>0;i--){
	System.out.println(i)
}
```
This will start indexing from 5 and will stop at zeroth element.

you are ready to go, onwards.
