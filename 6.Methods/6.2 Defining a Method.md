Well, let me be honest. You already know this. Except 
```java
public static int max()
``` 

What do I mean by this? You all declare functions. I declare 
```go
func KochisarliElvanDalton() {}
```
in GoLang.

Some of you declare
```python
def KochisarliElvanDalton():
	# do something
```
in Python.

or 
```rust
fn KochisarliElvanDalton(){}
```
in Rust.

This chapter is all about declaring functions. And calling it methods. I will discuss only things differ from here other normal languages than this abomination called Java, and end this chapter.

I will summarize it in my own words if you still didnt understand after the image on top. sorry for my oonga boonga english.

- **public**
	
	Every method starts with either public or private. This sets allowance to other classes to use this method. like, english. public to all classes, private to 	     the class that we wrote method in.
	
- **static**
	
	The `static` keyword is a non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.
	Like, let me give you an example:
	```java
	public class Foo(){
		public static void TestMethodStatic(){}
		public void TestMethodNonStatic(){}
	}
	```
	Every header must be either static, or non-static (implemented by simply not writing static.)
	If you use static, you can use `TestMethodStatic()` without creating a new Foo object.
	If method is not static, you must create a new Foo() object to use `TestMethodNonStatic()`. It will all make sense after Chapter 9, but i will dumb-down it.
	hold up.
	
	You visited a zoo. You see two monkeys. There is two **methods**you can give bananas to monkeys.  ( Let Zoo be a `public class Zoo()`)
	- One, feeding them directly. No zookeepers in between, so you dont need to instantiate a  **Zoo Object**, you can call `public static FeedMonkeys()` directly.
	- One, feeding them through zookeepers. Zookeepers gives the food to monkeys. You need to instantiate **Zoo Object** from `public class Zoo()` class so you can call `public FeedMonkeysWithZookepers()`
- int
	
	Type of the return value.
	
- max
	
	Method name.
	
- ()
	
	Parameters part.
	
Functions inside is outside of the scope of our topic.

You only need to master what the hell public and static means, and places to use them correctly. That is only can be done with coding practices, unfortunately.

You need to know pass-by-reference and pass-by value but I will show it in Chapter 7 due to only pass-by-reference types are arrays.
