Oh boy. Sit tight. This is your classic searching algorithms, from the Data Structures course, but in Java. If you already learned some syntax from previous subchapters, you need to derive a code from pseudocode already.

So I will only post pseudocodes. Deriving a code is your job from onwards. Check Chapter 7, page 289 if you want codes already, but it is 2 am and I am tired.

## The Linear Search Approach
The linear search approach compares the key element key sequentially with each element in the array. It continues to do so until the key matches an element in the array, or the array is
exhausted without a match being found. If a match is made, the linear search returns the index of the element in the array that matches the key. If no match is found, the search returns âˆ’1. 
## The Binary Search Approach
Binary search is the other common search approach for a list of values. For binary search to work, the elements in the array must already be ordered. Assume that the array is in ascending order. The binary search first compares the key with the element in the middle of the array.
Consider the following three cases:
1. If the key is less than the middle element, you need to continue to search for the key
only in the first half of the array.
2. If the key is equal to the middle element, the search ends with a match.
3. If the key is greater than the middle element, you need to continue to search for the key only in the second half of the array.
