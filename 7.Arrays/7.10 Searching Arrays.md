Oh boy. Sit tight. This is your classic searching algorithms, from the Data Structures course, but in Java.  ~~If you already learned some syntax from previous subchapters, you need to derive a code from pseudocode already. ~~

 ~~So I will only post pseudocodes.Deriving a code is your job from onwards. Check Chapter 7, page 289 if you want codes already, but it is 2 am and I am tired.~~

Never mind I decided to stay up for more.

## The Linear Search Approach
The linear search approach compares the key element key sequentially with each element in the array. It continues to do so until the key matches an element in the array, or the array is
exhausted without a match being found. If a match is made, the linear search returns the index of the element in the array that matches the key. If no match is found, the search returns −1.

The linear search method compares the key with each element in the array. The elements can
be in any order. On average, the algorithm will have to examine half of the elements in an
array before finding the key, if it exists. Since the execution time of a linear search increases
linearly as the number of array elements increases, linear search is inefficient for a large array.

## The Binary Search Approach
Binary search is the other common search approach for a list of values. For binary search to work, the elements in the array must already be ordered. Assume that the array is in ascending order. The binary search first compares the key with the element in the middle of the array.
Consider the following three cases:
1. If the key is less than the middle element, you need to continue to search for the key
only in the first half of the array.
2. If the key is equal to the middle element, the search ends with a match.
3. If the key is greater than the middle element, you need to continue to search for the key only in the second half of the array.

Clearly, the binary search method eliminates at least half of the array after each comparison.
Sometimes you eliminate half of the elements, and sometimes you eliminate half plus one.
Suppose the array has n elements. 

For convenience, let n be a power of 2. After the first comparison, n/2 elements are left for further search; after the second comparison, (n/2)/2 elements are left. After the kth comparison, n/2k elements are left for further search. 
When $k = log2n$, only one element is left in the array, and you need only one more comparison. Therefore, in the worst case when using the binary search approach, you need $log2n+1$ comparisons to find an element in the sorted array. 

In the worst case for a list of 1024 (210) elements, binary search requires only 11 comparisons, whereas a linear search requires 1023 comparisons inthe worst case.

The portion of the array being searched shrinks by half after each comparison. Let low and high denote, respectively, the first index and last index of the array that is currently being searched. Initially, low is 0 and high is list.length − 1. Let mid denote the index of the middle element, so mid is (low + high)/2. Figure shows how to find key 11 in the list {2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 45, 50, 59, 60, 66, 69, 70, 79} using binary search.

You now know how the binary search works. The next task is to implement it in Java.

Don’t rush to give a complete implementation. Implement it incrementally, one step at a time. You
may start with the first iteration of the search, as shown. It compares the key with the middle element in the list whose low index is 0 and high index is list.length−1. If key < list[mid], set the high index to mid − 1; 

if key == list[mid], a match is found and return mid; 

if key > list[mid], set the low index to mid + 1.

Next, consider implementing the method to perform the search repeatedly by adding a loop,
as shown in Figure 7.10b. The search ends if the key is found, or if the key is not found when
low > high.

```java
public static int binarySearch(
  int[] list, int key) {
  int low = 0;
  int high = list.length− 1;
  int mid = (low + high) / 2;
  if (key < list[mid])
    high = mid− 1;
  else if (key == list[mid])
    return mid;
  else
    low = mid + 1;
}
```
Okay what do we missing? We dont return the no result case.
```java
public static int binarySearch(
  int[] list, int key) {
  int low = 0;
  int high = list.length− 1;
  while (high >= low) {
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    if (key < list[mid])
      high = mid - 1;
    else if (key == list[mid])
      return mid;
    else
      low = mid + 1;
  }
  return -1; // Not found
}
```

it is really easy, even easier in C or golang. onwards!
