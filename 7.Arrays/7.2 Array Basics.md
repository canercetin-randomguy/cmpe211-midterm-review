## Declaring Array Variables

```java

elementType[] arrayRefVar;

```

such as

```java

int[] arrayRefVar;

```

is used for declaring an empty array of elementType called ArrayRefVar.

## Creating Arrays

```java

elementType[] arrayRefVar = new elementType[arraySize];

```

such as

```java

// creates a new double array that is length is 10.

double[] myList = new double[10];

```

Array is illustrated with:

Assuming reader passed variables to myList by
```java
myList[0] = 5.6;
```
and so on.

## Array Size and Default Values
When an array is created, its elements are assigned the default value of `0` for the numeric
primitive data types, `\u0000` for char types, and `false` for boolean types. 
Array size can be retrieved from:
```java
arrayRefVar.length
```
where arrayRefVar is the initalized array such as myList from previous subchapter.

## Accessing Array Elements
The array elements are accessed through the index. Array indices are 0 based; that is, they
range from 0 to arrayRefVar.length âˆ’ 1. In the example in previous subchapters, myList holds 10 double values, and the indices are from 0 to 9.

Each element in the array is represented using:
```java
arrayRefVar[index];
```
for example 
```java
myList[9]
```
means represents the last element in the array myList. 
Array elements can be iterated by:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < myList.length; i++) { // for every i index in leng
	myList[i] = i;
}
```
## Array Initializers
Array can be initialized with value by
```java
double[] myList = {1.9,2.9,3.4,3.5};
```
This is equal to
```java
double[] myList = new double[4];
myList[0] = 1.9;
myList[1] = 2.9;
myList[2] = 3.4;
myList[3] = 3.5;
```
## Processing Arrays
When processing array elements, you will often use a for loop for one of two reasons:
1. All of the elements in an array are of the same type. They are evenly processed in the
same fashion repeatedly using a loop.
2. Since the size of the array is known, it is natural to use a for loop.
The following are some examples of processing arrays:
- Initializing arrays with input values:
```java
// Initialization of system scanner
java.util.Scanner input = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);
// Print.
System.out.print("Enter " + myList.length + " values: ");
// Request total of mylist's length of values.
for (int i = 0; i < myList.length; i++) {myList[i] = input.nextDouble();}
```
Reader can just know `myList[i]` (i = index) can be used for displaying the array element, and use his/her imagination to solve examples. 

I mean, come on, I literally specified that this guides are intended for actively coding readers that wants to skim for CMPE211 midterm.

Array values can be assigned to array values. Yes I actually wrote this sentence.
Check this shifting elements to the left example:
```java
for (int i = 1; i < myList.length; i++) {
	myList[i - 1] = myList[i];
}
```
## Foreach Loops
Java supports a convenient for loop, known as a foreach loop. 
This is similar to:
```go
for key,value := range TestArray{
	fmt.Println(key,value)
}
```
in GoLang, but it is shorter.
```java
for (double e: myList) {
	System.out.println(e);
}
```
Where keys are gone, e is the value that is automatically assigned to next index during for loop. General syntax is:
```java
for (elementType element: arrayRefVar) {
	// do something with every element in arrayRefVar, one element at a time.
}
```
