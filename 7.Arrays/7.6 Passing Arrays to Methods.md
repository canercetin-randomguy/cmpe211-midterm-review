Just as you can pass primitive type values to methods, you can also pass arrays to methods.
For example, the following method displays the elements in an int array:
```java
public static void printArray(int[] array) {
	for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
		System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
	}
}
```
Similar to:
```go
func somerandomfunction(someRandomArray []int){}
```
in GoLang.

Java uses pass-by-value to pass arguments to a method. There are important differences between passing the values of variables of primitive data types and passing arrays.

- For an argument of a primitive type, the argumentâ€™s value is passed.
-  For an argument of an array type, the value of the argument is a reference to an array. This reference value is passed to the method. Semantically, it can be best described as pass-by-sharing, that is, the array in the method is the same as the array being passed.Thus, if you change the array in the method, you will see the change outside the method.
Like:
```java
public class TestArrayArguments {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x = 1; // x represents an int value
		int[] y = new int[10]; // y represents an array of int values
		m(x, y); // Invoke m with arguments x and y
		System.out.println("x is " + x);
		System.out.println("y[0] is " + y[0]);
	}
	public static void m(int number, int[] numbers) {
		number = 1001; // Assign a new value to number
		numbers[0] = 5555; // Assign a new value to numbers[0]
	}
}
```
will print
```
x is 1
y[0] is 5555
```
because primitive data types are pass-by-value and arrays are pass-by-reference. java is a dumb language, I know. Check this out:

The primitive type value in x is passed to number, and the reference value in y is passed to numbers. got it? nice.
still didnt understand it? okay check this out, got you covered homie.

You want to swap the values of array, to become {2,1}.
You first invoke swap() function:
```java
public static void swap(int n1, int n2){
	int temp = n1;
	n1=n2;
	n2=temp;
}
```
with values of 
```java
swap(a[0],a[1]);
```
that corresponds to 1 and 2. so? what will happen? nothing. why? because `swap` method is accepting primitive data types as parameters.
```java
public static void swap(int n1, int n2){}
```
so first 11 lines will print:
```
Before invoking swap
array is {1, 2}
After invoking swap
array is {1, 2}
```
after that failure,  you pass the whole array to
```java
public static void swapFirstTwoInArray(int[] array) {
	int temp = array[0];
	array[0] = array[1];
	array[1] = temp;
}
```
in line 16. so? what will happen? variables will be swapped! why? because `swapFirstTwoInArray` is accepting array as parameters, that is pass-by-reference.

still didnt understand it? read pass-by-value and pass-by-reference's definition from wikipedia, or elsewhere.

now, onwards.
