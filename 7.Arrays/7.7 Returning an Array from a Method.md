You can pass arrays when invoking a method. A method may also return an array. For example, the following method returns an array that is the reversal of another array
```java
public static int[] reverse(int[] list){}
```
is an example header. lets break it down.
```java
public = can other classes use this?
static = Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.
int[] = means RETURN A INT ARRAY.
(int[] list) = parameters.
```
e.g:
```java
public static int[] reverse(int[] list) {
	int[] result = new int[list.length];

	for (int i = 0, j = result.length - 1;
		i < list.length; i++, j--) {
		result[j] = list[i];
	}

	return result;
}
```
onward!
