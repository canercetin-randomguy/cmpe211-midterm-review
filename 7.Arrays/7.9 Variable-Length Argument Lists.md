 Suppose that you have a number set like this
 ```java
 (34, 3, 3, 2, 56.5)
```
instead of creating a method like
```java
public static void printMax(a int, b int, c int)
```
and so on, you do:
```java
public static void printMax(double... numbers)
```
general syntax:
```java
methodName(typeName... parameterName)
```
![[Pasted image 20221126235053.png]]
Line 3 invokes the printMax method with a variable-length argument list passed to the array numbers. If no arguments are passed, the length of the array is 0 (line 8). 
Line 4 invokes the printMax method with an array.

Got it? man I love you. onwards!
