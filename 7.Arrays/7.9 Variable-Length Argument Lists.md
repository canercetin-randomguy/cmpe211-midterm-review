 Suppose that you have a number set like this
 ```java
 (34, 3, 3, 2, 56.5)
```
instead of creating a method like
```java
public static void printMax(a int, b int, c int)
```
and so on, you do:
```java
public static void printMax(double... numbers)
```
general syntax:
```java
methodName(typeName... parameterName)
```

Line 3 invokes the printMax method with a variable-length argument list passed to the array numbers. If no arguments are passed, the length of the array is 0 (line 8). 

Line 4 invokes the printMax method with an array.

Now remember the primitive data types are pass-by-value and arrays are pass-by-reference, find out what the input will be!

onwards!
