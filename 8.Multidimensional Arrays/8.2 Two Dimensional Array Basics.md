## Declaration and Creation
cool title. 

The syntax for declaring a two-dimensional array is as follows:
```java
elementType[][] arrayRefVar;
```
or 
```java
/* please dont use this, for clarity elementType[] is always used, but who knows? they may ask *which ones  are valid in the below* 
and put elementType[] arrayRefVar and elementType arrayRefVar[] at the  same time to answers. 
good to know it, but please, use the declaration above in real world. */
elementType arrayRefVar[][]
```
As an example, here is how you would declare a two-dimensional array variable matrix of int values:
```java
int[][] matrix;
```
again, you can use
```java
int matrix[][];
```
but please remember my comment.
You can create a two-dimensional array of 5-by-5 int values and assign it to matrix using this syntax:
```java
matrix = new int[5][5];
```
In my own words
```java
variableName = new variableType[first dimension size & amount of rows][second dimension size & amount of columns]
```

To assign the value 7 to a specific element at row index 2 and column index 1, as shown in part (b) in figure above, you can use the following syntax:
```java
matrix[2][1]=7;
```
You can also use an array initializer to declare, create, and initialize a two-dimensional array.

For example, the following code creates an array with the specified initial values, as shown in the (c) part of the figure above.

```java
int[][] array = {
	{1, 2, 3},
	{4, 5, 6},
	{7, 8, 9},
	{10, 11, 12}
};
```
This is equivalent to (shown in part (b))
```java
int[][] array = new int[4][3];
array[0][0] = 1; array[0][1] = 2; array[0][2] = 3;
array[1][0] = 4; array[1][1] = 5; array[1][2] = 6;
array[2][0] = 7; array[2][1] = 8; array[2][2] = 9;
array[3][0] = 10; array[3][1] = 11; array[3][2] = 12;
```

## Obtaining the Length
Every row's length is specified by themselves. Like, remember the array length?
```java
x = new int[3]
System.out.println(x.length)
```
This will print 3, due to array being 3 integers long.
Now look:
```java
x = new int[3][4];
```
If you print 
```java
System.out.println(x.length);
```
This will print 3 again, due to array being 3 **ROWS** long. buuut,
```java
System.out.println(x[0].length);
System.out.println(x[1].length);
System.out.println(x[2].length);
```
These will all print 4. Why? because every row contains 4 elements. Remember that:
```java
x = new int[ROW_AMOUNT][COLUMN_AMOUNT];
```
Got it? man I love you.

## Ragged Arrays
Each row in a two-dimensional array is itself an array. Thus, the rows can have different lengths. An array of this kind is known as a ragged array. Here is an example of creating a ragged array:

![img](https://github.com/canercetin-randomguy/cmpe211-midterm-review/blob/main/8.Multidimensional%20Arrays/Pasted%20image%2020221127112306.png)

Okay, now:
```java
System.out.println(triangleArray[0].length);
System.out.println(triangleArray[1].length);
System.out.println(triangleArray[2].length);
System.out.println(triangleArray[3].length);
System.out.println(triangleArray[4].length);
```
All will print 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 consequently, showing the column amount in each row, or data amount in arrays.

Following code can be used for changing values:

```java
triangleArray[0][3] = 4;
triangleArray[4][0] = 5;
```
Tho, you cant assign to out of bounds:
```java
triangleArray[4][2] = 10;
```
will give you error because fourth row only has one column / data space.

If you don’t know the values in a ragged array in advance, but do know the sizes—say, the same as in the preceding figure—you can create a ragged array using the following syntax:

```java
int[][] triangleArray = new int[5][];
triangleArray[0] = new int[5];
triangleArray[1] = new int[4];
triangleArray[2] = new int[3];
triangleArray[3] = new int[2];
triangleArray[4] = new int[1];
```

Due to every row being a seperate array.

The syntax `new int[5][]` for creating an array requires the first index to be specified. Syntax `new int[][]` would be wrong.

onwards!
