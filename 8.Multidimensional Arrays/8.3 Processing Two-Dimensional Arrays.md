Nested for loops are often used to process a two-dimensional array.
I will continue with my own words, and hopefully you will have some ideas:
```java
int[][] matrix = new int[10][10];
```
Okay, remember every row is a seperate array itself? There is 10 different arrays initialized with each of them containing 10 data spaces/columns.

And remember how to iterate over array?
```java
for(int i = 0; i < somerandomarray.length; i++){}
```
Now, for two dimensionals, first iterate over rows.
```java
for(int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++}{
	// do something with rows
}
```
now, every `matrix[row]` represents a row in matrix.

Afterwards, iterate over columns.
```java
for(int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++}{
	for(int column = 0; column < matrix[row].length; column++){
		// do something with matrix[row][column]
	}
}
```
And now,you can access the values with `matrix[row][column]`.

By my words:
```java
row -> 1
row -> 1 -> column = 0 -> matrix[row][column] = matrix[1][0]
row -> 1 -> column = 1
row -> 1 -> column = 2
row -> 1 -> column = 3
...
row -> 2 -> column = 0 -> matrix[row][column] = matrix[2][0]
row -> 2 -> column = 1
row -> 2 -> column = 2
row -> 2 -> column = 3
...
```
This is how literally iteration works.

For example:
```java
for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {
	for (int column = 0; column < matrix[row].length; column++) {
	matrix[row][column] = (int)(Math.random() * 100);
	}
}
```
Will fill matrix with random values, or

```java
for (int row = 0; row < matrix.length; row++) {
	for (int column = 0; column < matrix[row].length; column++) {
	System.out.print(matrix[row][column] + " ");
	}
	System.out.println();
}
```
Will print the values in matrix.

If you know the basic of iterating over rows and columns, solving questions are only depending on your algorithm solving skills. Cause that is it about it.
