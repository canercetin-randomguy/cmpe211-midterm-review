When passing a two-dimensional array to a method, the reference of the array is passed to the method.

Remember, primitive data types are pass-by-value and arrays are pass-by-reference as I talked about it in 7.Arrays.

```java
public static int[][] getArray() {}
```
is the common header.

```java
public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[][] array = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}};
		System.out.println(m1(array)[0]);
		System.out.println(m1(array)[1]);
	}
	public static int[] m1(int[][] m) {
		int[] result = new int[2];
		result[0] = m.length;
		result[1] = m[0].length;
		return result;
	}
}
```
Let me explain this code to you.
```java
int[][] array = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}};
```
is 2D array declaration with 2x4 normal arrays.
```java
System.out.println(m1(array)[0]);
```
Pass the whole array to the m1 function (???). Whatever keyboard this exercise is written is needed to be burned with this code snippet, but whatever. I stopped judging this reference book long time ago.

```java
int[] result = new int[2];
```
Declare a new integer array with 2 size.
```java
result[0] = m.length;
```
Assign passed 2D array's length (as a whole),
```java
int[][] array;
```
in our case, to the result's first data space.

Assign passed 2D array's **first rows length** to the results second data space.
```java
result[1] = m[0].length;
```
Return the result.
```java
return result
```
Now,
```java
System.out.println(m1(array)[0]);
System.out.println(m1(array)[1]);
```
Remember results first data space holds the matrices length as a whole, and second data space holds the first rows length (column amount).

It prints 2 and 4.
