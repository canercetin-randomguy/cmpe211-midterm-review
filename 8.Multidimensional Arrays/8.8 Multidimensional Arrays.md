A two-dimensional array is an array of one-dimensional arrays, and a three-dimensional array is an array of two-dimensional arrays. In the preceding section, you used a two-dimensional array to represent a matrix or a table.
Occasionally, you will need to represent n-dimensional data structures. In Java, you can create n-dimensional arrays for any positive integer n.

The way to declare two-dimensional array variables and create two-dimensional arrays can be generalized to declare n-dimensional array variables and create n-dimensional arrays for
n >= 3. For example, you may use a three-dimensional array to store exam scores for a class of six students with five exams, and each exam has two parts (multiple-choice and essay type
questions). The following syntax declares a three-dimensional array variable scores, creates an array, and assigns its reference to scores.

```java
double[][][] scores = new double[6][5][2];
```
You can also use the array initializer to create and initialize the array as follows:
```java
double[][][] scores = {
{{7.5, 20.5}, {9.0, 22.5}, {15, 33.5}, {13, 21.5}, {15, 2.5}},
{{4.5, 21.5}, {9.0, 22.5}, {15, 34.5}, {12, 20.5}, {14, 9.5}},
{{6.5, 30.5}, {9.4, 10.5}, {11, 33.5}, {11, 23.5}, {10, 2.5}},
{{6.5, 23.5}, {9.4, 32.5}, {13, 34.5}, {11, 20.5}, {16, 7.5}},
{{8.5, 26.5}, {9.4, 52.5}, {13, 36.5}, {13, 24.5}, {16, 2.5}},
{{9.5, 20.5}, {9.4, 42.5}, {13, 31.5}, {12, 20.5}, {16, 6.5}}};
```

`scores[0][1][0]` refers to the multiple-choice score for the first student’s second exam, which is 9.0. `scores[0][1][1]` refers to the essay score for the first student’s second exam, which is 22.5. This is depicted in the following figure:

A multidimensional array is actually an array in which each element is another array. A three-dimensional array is an array of two-dimensional arrays. A two-dimensional array is an array
of one-dimensional arrays.
