Object-oriented programming (OOP) involves programming using objects. An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified. Like, banana. I love banana.

An object has a unique identity, state, and behavior.
- The state of an object (also known as its properties or attributes) is represented by data fields with their current values. Consider a banana, it is 30 centimeters long. Why I even explain like this:
```java
public class Banana {
	double centimeters = 30.30; // data field
	Banana(){} // constructor
}
```
As you can see in the example, every class has data fields that will be attached to the object when you construct/insantiate a new object from class.
- The behavior of an object (also known as its actions) is defined by methods. To invoke a method on an object is to ask the object to perform an action. 
	```java
	public class Banana{
		double centimeters = 30.30; // data field
		Banana(){} // constructor
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
	}
	```
	

Objects of the same type are defined using a common class. A class is a template, blueprint, or contract that defines what an objectâ€™s data fields and methods will be.

An object is an instance of a class. You can create many instances of a class. Creating an instance is referred
to as instantiation. 

Like, you may have one banana type and many bananas from that banana type. got it? man, i love you, a lot.

The illustration of class templates and objects can be standardized using Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. 

```java
class Circle {
	/** The radius of this circle */
	double radius = 1;
	/** Construct a circle object */
	Circle() {}
	/** Construct a circle object */
	Circle(double newRadius) {
		radius = newRadius;
	}
	/** Return the area of this circle */
	double getArea() {
		return radius * radius * Math.PI;
	}
	/** Return the perimeter of this circle */
	double getPerimeter() {
		return 2 * radius * Math.PI;
	}
	/** Set a new radius for this circle */
	void setRadius(double newRadius) {
		radius = newRadius;
	}
}
```
UML class diagram for circle is:
![[Pasted image 20221127122817.png]]
The constructor is denoted as
```java
ClassName(parameterName: parameterType)
```
and data fields are denoted on top of the methods (seperated by line)
```java
dataFieldName: dataFieldType
```

You can put the two classes into one file, but only one class in the file can be a public class.

Furthermore, the public class must have the same name as the file name.

Suppose that you have a Banana.java file and you have:
```java
public class Banana(){}
public class Circle(){}
```
This definition is wrong. You can only have one public class in your file, and it must carry the same name with your java file.
Correct:
```java
public class Banana(){}
class Circle(){}
```
