Constructors are a special kind of method. They have three peculiarities:
- A constructor must have the same name as the class itself.
- Constructors do not have a return typeâ€”not even void.
- Constructors are invoked using the new operator when an object is created. Constructors play the role of initializing objects.

Consider my Banana example again because bananas are best thing that has ever existed.
```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters = 30.30; // data field
		Banana(){} // constructor
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
}
```
For getting new Banana objects you have to use:
```java
Banana monke = new Banana();
```
Why? Because:
```java
ClassName ObjectName = new ClassName();
```
Due to constructors have to carry class name rule, you have to call
```java
Banana()
```
to get a new Banana object.

...but what if you want to initialize it by 50 centimeters?
```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters = 30.30; // data field
		Banana(){} // constructor
		// constructor but with parameter
		Banana(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;
		}
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
}
```
You can override constructors. Now you can call
```java
Banana longermonke = new Banana(50.0);
```
to declare a Banana with new centimeters value.
