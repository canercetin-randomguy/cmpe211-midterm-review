Banana!
```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters = 30.30; // data field
		Banana(){} // constructor
		// constructor but with parameter
		Banana(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;
		}
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
}
```
In OOP terminology, an objectâ€™s member refers to its data fields and methods. After an object is created, its data can be accessed and its methods can be invoked using the dot operator (.), also known as the object member access operator:
For example, get a new object:
```java
Banana monke = new Banana()
```
You can access data fields of the monke, a Banana class object.
```java
System.out.println(monke.centimeters)
```
You can invoke methods of Banana class, by using monke, a Banana class object.
```java
System.out.println(monke.getBananaSize())
```
**BUT**. Remember Zookeper example I give in Methods chapter while explaining static keyword? Where you have to insantiate an object to use methods that can only be used with Classes? Yes!

```java
System.out.println(Banana.getBananaSize())
```
You cant do this. Because getBananaSize is not a static method, you have to get a new Banana object.
```java
Banana monke = new Banana()
System.out.println(monke.getBananaSize())
```
Lets declare a new static method.
```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters = 30.30; // data field
		Banana(){} // constructor
		// constructor but with parameter
		Banana(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;
		}
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
		public static string ReturnToMonke(){
			return "reject humanity embrace monke"
		}
}
```
You can call
```java
System.out.println(Banana.ReturnToMonke())
```
without making a new monke object, due to ReturnToMonke being static method.

got it? DUDE I LOVE YOU.

but we have some more problems.
```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters; // data field
		Banana(){} // constructor
		// constructor but with parameter
		Banana(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;
		}
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
		public static string ReturnToMonke(){
			return "reject humanity embrace monke"
		}
}
```
What if you didnt give centimeters a default value, insantiated a new monke object:
```java
Banana monke = new Banana()
```
without a centimeter value? Yes, centimeter will be default double value.
If you try to access 
```java
monke.centimeters
```
in this scenario, you will get default value 0.

If centimeters was a local variable, lets assume:
```java
public class BananabutWorse(){
	public static void main(String[] args){
		double centimeters;
		System.out.println(centimeters)
	}
}
```
This will cause compiler error because local variables defaults are null.

Objects are reference types, just like arrays.

Lets say you have two banana objects
```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters; // data field
		Banana(){} // constructor
		// constructor but with parameter
		Banana(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;
		}
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
		public static string ReturnToMonke(){
			return "reject humanity embrace monke"
		}
}
```

```java
Banana monke = new Banana();
Banana gorilla = new Banana();
```

Okay. First, let me remark you primitive types:
```java
int x=5;
int y=0;
```
When you do:
```java
x=y;
```
x and y simply becomes 5.
```java
x=8;
```
If you assign x to 8, y will stay as 5. Why? because x and y is both primitive data types, and address of them in the memory stays seperate when you do x=y.

But, if you assign two class objects to themselves:
```java
monke=gorilla;
```
Any change to monke will also be done to gorilla. Why? Because objects are reference data types and when you assign a class object to an another same class object, both addresses in the memory will be same.

As you see in the figure, monke and gorilla is carrying the same addresses now.

You can also store objects in arrays. 
Since objects are also considered as datatypes (reference) in Java, you can create an array of the type of a particular class and, populate it with instances of that class.
```java
Banana monkeTogetherStrong = new Banana[1];
```
then you can assign to object array by
```java
monkeTogetherStrong[0] = new Banana();
```
