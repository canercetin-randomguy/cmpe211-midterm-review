The data field radius in the circle class is known as an instance variable. An instance variable is tied to a specific instance of the class; it is not shared among objects of the same class. For
example, suppose that you create the following objects:
```java
Banana monke = new Banana();
Banana gorilla = new Banana();
```
Changes to monke does not affect gorilla. You have to assign monke to gorilla for that.
```java
monke=gorilla
```
If you want all the instances of a class to share data, use static variables, also known as class variables. Static variables store values for the variables in a common memory location.

Because of this common location, if one object changes the value of a static variable, all objects of the same class are affected.

Java supports static methods as well as static variables. Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class. (Check 9.5 for what this actually means, its somewhere there.)
```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters; // data field
		static int monkeCount;
		Banana(){} // constructor
		// constructor but with parameter
		Banana(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;
		}
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
		public static string ReturnToMonke(){
			return "reject humanity embrace monke"
		}
		public static int getMonkes() {
			return monkeCount
		}
}
```

See that we declared a 
```java
static int monkeCount;
```
static class variable and a static method:
```java
public static int getMonkes() {
			return monkeCount
}
```
without writing any code, monkeCount default is 0.
```java
System.out.Println(Banana.monkeCount) // 0
```

```java
Banana monke = new Banana();
Banana.monkeCount += 1
Banana gorilla = new Banana();
Banana.monkeCount += 1
```

Now you have declared two Banana objects. and increased Banana.monkeCount by 2.
```java
Banana.monkeCount += 1
```
Now print
```java
System.out.Println(Banana.monkeCount) // 2
```
You can also get static variables by
```java
System.out.Println(monke.monkeCount)
```

If you want constant static variables, you can declare them as final static. 
```java
public class Banana(){
	final static int BananaCount = 5
	...
}
```
This is similar to `const` in GoLang. You cant change constant variables, but access them (static ones) without creating an object.

Now we have a bigger problem.

Consider our Banana class.
```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters; // data field
		static int monkeCount;
		Banana(){} // constructor
		// constructor but with parameter
		Banana(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;
		}
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
		public static string ReturnToMonke(){
			return "reject humanity embrace monke"
		}
		public static int getMonkes() {
			return monkeCount
		}
}
```

Non-static methods are called instance methods. For example
```java
double getBananaSize(){}
```
is an instance method, due to not having a static keyword.
It can access,invoke every instance or static method and variables. Such as
```java
double centimeters; // instance data field
static int monkeCount; // static data field
double getBananaSize(){} // instance method
public static int getmonkes(){} // static method
```

Static methods cannot access instance variables.
```java
public static int getMonkes() {
	int j = centimeters;
	return monkeCount
}
```
Okay do you see that
```java
int j = centimeters;
```
line? Yes, that is wrong. Because j is a static variable that is declared in a static method, and centimeters is an instance variable without static keyword.
```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters; // instance data field
		...
}
```
Static methods cannot invoke instance methods.
```java
public static int getMonkes() {
	int j = centimeters; // cannot access instance data f.
	getBananaSize(); // wrong!
	return monkeCount
}
```
Okay, now do you see that
```java
getBananaSize();
```
line? Yes that is wrong too. Because getBananaSize() is not a static method, it is a instance method.
```java
public class Banana(){
	...
	double getBananaSize(){ // instance method
			return centimeters
	}
	...
}
```
