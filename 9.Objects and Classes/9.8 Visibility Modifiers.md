This section is highly bloated in book. Like, come on.
You have packages like this:
Banana.java
```java
package Zoo;
public class Banana {
	public int banana;
}
```
then you create another class, in a file called Gorilla.java
```java
package Zoo;
public class Gorilla{
	private string hungry;
}
```
So what is the difference? Public means every class that access a class can use that public variable.

So if you try to access Banana's variable:
```java
public int banana;
```
from Gorilla class, you can, but if you try to access Gorilla's variable:
```java
private string hungry;
```
from Banana class, you cant, because hungry string variable is private and can be only used in Gorilla class.

protected modifier is in Chapter 11.14, outside of midterms scope.
