```java
public class Banana{
		double centimeters; // data field
		static int monkeCount;
		Banana(){} // constructor
		// constructor but with parameter
		Banana(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;
		}
		double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
		public static string ReturnToMonke(){
			return "reject humanity embrace monke"
		}
		public static int getMonkes() {
			return monkeCount
		}
}
```
Now, I told you that you can access monkeCount without creating a new Banana object right?
```java
System.out.println(Banana.monkeCount);
```
Yeah dont do that for your own sanity, and others that will look into your code, but know that you can do it. Just, know it, dont do it.

Why?
- Data may be tampered with.
	You may accidentally write and lose the count of the objects (monkes in our case.). Dont say I wont do that, we all do dumb things and try to debug it for 6 hours straight.
	```java
	Banana.monkeCount = 15;
	```
- The class becomes difficult to maintain and vulnerable to bugs.
	Suppose that you want to modify the Banana class to ensure that the centimeters is nonnegative after other programs have already used the class. You have to change not only the Circle class but also the programs that use it because the clients may have modified the radius directly.
To prevent direct modifications of data fields, you should declare the data fields private, using the private modifier. This is known as data field encapsulation.

...but Cansu how do we get the private data fields in our code?
Set getter and setter.

A getter method is also referred to as an accessor and a setter to a mutator. 

A getter/accessor method has thte following signature:
```java
public returnType getPropertyName()
```

If the returnType is boolean, the getter method should be defined as follows by convention:
```java
public boolean isPropertyName()
```
Conventions are not important, but again, this whole chapter is aimed for preserving your sanity while coding.

A setter/mutator method has the following signature:
```java
public void setPropertyName(dataType propertyValue)
```
Now, lets modify our precious Banana.
```java
public class Banana{
		private double centimeters; // data field
		private static int monkeCount;
		Banana(){} // constructor
		// constructor but with parameter
		Banana(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;
		}
		public void reduceMonke(){
			monkeCount = monkeCount - 1;
		}
		public void incrementMonke(){
			monkeCount = monkeCount + 1;
		}
		public int getMonkeCount(){
			return monkeCount
		}
		public double setBananaSize(double cm){
			centimeters=cm;	
		}
		public double getBananaSize(){ // method
			return centimeters
		}
		public static string ReturnToMonke(){
			return "reject humanity embrace monke"
		}
		public static int getMonkes() {
			return monkeCount
		}
}
```
What did we do? We first
```java
private double centimeters;
private static int monkeCount;
```
set the centimeters and monkeCount to private use.

Then, 
```java
public void reduceMonke(){
	monkeCount = monkeCount - 1;
}
public void incrementMonke(){
	monkeCount = monkeCount + 1;
}
public int getMonkeCount(){
	return monkeCount
}
```
added setter and getter functions for monkeCount, as monkeCount is only can be modified in Banana class.

Then,
```java
public double setBananaSize(double cm){
	centimeters=cm;	
}
public double getBananaSize(){ // method
	return centimeters
}
```
added setter and getter functions for centimeters variable, as it can only be modified in Banana class.

Remember UML diagrams that you draw for classes?

The `-` sign indicates private method or variable.

The `+` sign indicates public method or variable.

As I said, these are all optional, but please do and remember these.
