## Anything related to libraries will not be covered.
We are taking on-paper exams in the 21st century, do you really think they will allow us to use library? Pass everything related to libraries.
This is totally not a passive-aggressive rant about taking on-paper exams on a slow and obscure as hell language.

This book is based on Liang's Introduction to Java, and all those markdown files are written assuming you are already an active coder in a language.

First two chapters includes: 

-Introduction to computers, which you learned from digital logic systems.
-Elementary programming

So we pass them.

Chapter 3 includes if else statements that is in same syntax with every single language in the existence, if you arent a COBOL coder. Passing it.

Chapter 4 is about Math library. Read the top.

Chapter 5 includes do{}while() and for(int i=0;i<something;i++) loops that is in same syntax with C, and almost every language. Pass.
